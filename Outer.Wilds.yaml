  spawn:
    # Where you wake up at the start of each loop.
    #
    # 'vanilla' is the same as the base game: you wake up in TH Village, talk to Hornfels to get the Launch Codes, then walk by the Nomai statue to start the time loop.
    # All other options (including timber_hearth) will spawn you in your spacesuit, with the time loop already started, and the Launch Codes item placed randomly like any other AP item.
    #
    # The idea is that non-vanilla spawns will require you to play "shipless" for a while, possibly using Nomai Warp Codes to visit other planets. The ship will still spawn nearby, so you can use the ship log/tracker right away.
    # When playing with non-vanilla spawns, we recommend:
    # - Consider enabling randomize_warp_pads for greater variety if you get warp codes early
    # - Consider enabling early_key_item in non-solo games, or else your first session may end after only 4-10 checks
    # - Install a fast-forward mod such as Alter Time or Cheat And Debug Mod, since you may need to do a lot of waiting for e.g. Ash Twin sand or Giant's Deep islands

  early_key_item:
    # Ensure that either Translator, Nomai Warp Codes, or Launch Codes will be somewhere in sphere 1 and
    # in your own world, guaranteeing you can find it without waiting on other players.
    # `any` randomly selects one of these items to place early.
    # 
    # Recommended for games with non-vanilla spawns, especially async games.
    # In addition, without this AP seems to almost always put Launch Codes in sphere 1, so `any` also helps increase variety.

  randomize_coordinates:

    true: 50

  randomize_orbits:
    # Randomizes:
    # - The order of the five planets (the Hourglass Twins as a whole, Timber Hearth, Brittle Hollow, Giant's Deep, Dark Bramble), i.e. which ones are closer or farther from the sun
    # - The orbit angles of the five planets, as well as four satellites (Sun Station, Attlerock, Hollow's Lantern, and the Orbital Probe Cannon)
    # - The axes of rotation for Ember Twin, Ash Twin, Timber Hearth and Brittle Hollow. This often causes the Hourglass Twins' sand pillar to pass through different areas.
    false: 0
    true: 50

  randomize_warp_platforms:
    # Randomize which Nomai warp platforms are connected to each other.
    # Warp connections are still 'coupled', i.e. if platform A warps to platform B, then B will take you back to A.
    # Highly recommended when playing with non-vanilla spawns.
    'false': 50
    'true': 0

  randomize_dark_bramble_layout:
    # Randomizes which Dark Bramble 'rooms' link to which other rooms, so you can't rely on your memory of the vanilla layout.
    # Be aware that randomized layouts are often significantly harder to navigate than vanilla Dark Bramble, since they allow several paths to the same room and more complex loops / recursion.
    # 'hub_start' forces the first room to be Hub (same as the vanilla game), which tends to generate shorter and simpler paths than full randomization.
    false: 50
    true: 0
    hub_start: 0

  trap_chance:
    # The probability for each filler item (including unique filler) to be replaced with a trap item.
    # The exact number of trap items will still be somewhat random, so you can't know
    # if you've seen the 'last trap' in your world without checking the spoiler log.
    # If you don't want any traps, set this to 0.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 100

  trap_type_weights:
    # When a filler item is replaced with a trap, these weights determine the
    # odds for each trap type to be selected.
    # If you don't want a specific trap type, set its weight to 0.
    # Setting all weights to 0 is the same as setting trap_chance to 0.
    Audio Trap: 1
    Nap Trap: 2
    Ship Damage Trap: 2

  death_link:
    # When you die, everyone dies. Of course the reverse is true too.
    # The "default" option will not include deaths to meditation, the supernova or the time loop ending.
    # Be aware that the game mod provides a 'Death Link Override' setting, in case you change your mind later.

  shuffle_spacesuit:
    # Puts the spacesuit into the Archipelago item pool, forcing you to play suitless until it's found.
    #
    # This option is incompatible with non-vanilla spawns (i.e. generation will fail), since those imply playing "shipless" at first, and almost nothing can be done both shipless and suitless.
