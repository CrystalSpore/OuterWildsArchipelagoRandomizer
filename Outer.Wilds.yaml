  randomize_orbits:
    # Randomizes:
    # - The order of the five planets (the Hourglass Twins as a whole, Timber Hearth, Brittle Hollow, Giant's Deep, Dark Bramble), i.e. which ones are closer or farther from the sun
    # - The orbit angles of the five planets, as well as four satellites (Sun Station, Attlerock, Hollow's Lantern, and the Orbital Probe Cannon)

  randomize_dark_bramble_layout:
    # Randomizes which Dark Bramble 'rooms' link to which other rooms, so you can't rely on your memory of the vanilla
    # layout. Be aware that randomized layouts are often significantly harder to navigate than vanilla Dark Bramble,
    # since they allow several paths to the same room and more complex loops / recursion.

  trap_chance:
    # The probability for each filler item (including unique filler) to be replaced with a trap item.
    # The exact number of trap items will still be somewhat random, so you can't know
    # if you've seen the 'last trap' in your world without checking the spoiler log.
    # If you don't want any traps, set this to 0.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0

  trap_type_weights:
    # When a filler item is replaced with a trap, these weights determine the
    # odds for each trap type to be selected.
    # If you don't want a specific trap type, set its weight to 0.
    # Setting all weights to 0 is the same as setting trap_chance to 0.

  death_link:
    # When you die, everyone dies. Of course the reverse is true too.
